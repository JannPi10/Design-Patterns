# Design Patterns in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of 22 classic software design patterns, each with a simple example of usage.  
The goal is to provide clear, minimal, and practical code samples that demonstrate how each pattern works in real scenarios.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/ # Documentation (currently empty)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/ # 22 Python scripts, one for each design pattern
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/ # Unit tests (currently empty)
â””â”€â”€ README.md


- **`src/`** â€” Contains the Python implementation of each pattern, along with a usage example.
- **`docs/`** â€” Reserved for additional documentation in the future.
- **`tests/`** â€” Intended for automated tests.

## â–¶ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JannPi10/Design-Patterns.git
   cd Design-Patterns
2. Navigate to the src folder and run the desired pattern file:
   python src/singleton.py
   Replace singleton.py with the filename of the pattern you want to execute.
   
ðŸ›  Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
No additional external libraries are required.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Add detailed documentation in the docs/ folder.

Implement unit tests in the tests/ folder.

Provide extended real-world usage examples.
